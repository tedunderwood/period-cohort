But it still seems fair to categorize it under event, because a war generally is one--whenever it happens.

The topic is spread across science fiction and mystery. *We* ordinarily call these distinct genres. But it highlights something SF has in common with e20c mystery: an interest in sage/professor types (viz Sherlock Holmes). And I'm not sure it was clear  at the time these genres were distinct. Entropy is below 10 and r1 ratio above 2.6.

There is a little bit of nonfiction mixed in here, but some things that look like nonfic are actually  stories, and the topic is too widely dispersed  to worry that it's defined by the nonfic.

French and Italian writers in translation, several of them sharing an interest in irony or regret. I don't know how they're being grouped! I even checked to see if they're all translated by the same person: apparently not! Lots of rank 1 docs; this is a genre!

I suspect what we're really seeing here is a  particular kind of work that has sufficient literary ambition to GET translated. A lot of them are  short stories.

Slightly lower entropy than topic 32, even though this is a bigger topic—also more tightly focused on the timeline. I'd say 'genre.'

Top 7 books have little in common; all I we have to go on is the vocab: plural nouns, 'crowd,' 'group,' etc. 'Heads' is a bit of a tell; you count them when ppl are viewed as a mass.
