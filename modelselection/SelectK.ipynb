    "# Selecting the number of topics\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook selects *k,* the number of topics in our model, using the ground truth of human categorization as a guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have tried a number of different schemes for selecting the optimal number of topics in a model. [Wallach et al. (2009)](http://dirichlet.net/pdf/wallach09evaluation.pdf) proposed using the model to make predictions on held-out documents. A few years later, [Mimno et al. (2013)](http://dirichlet.net/pdf/mimno11optimizing.pdf) introduced semantic coherence measures as a different strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, both of these strategies are still in use, but a variety of other measures are also commonly deployed to optimize *k*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no settled best practice, of course, because the algorithms for topic modeling don't in themselves imply a criterion for deciding between models with different numbers of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the empirical experience of researchers, models with different numbers of topics are often equally effective as dimension-reductions of a corpus. Researchers use dimension-reduction methods pragmatically, to simplify a problem space, and the operation doesn't necessarily depend on the premise that there is any optimal number of dimensions. If topic modeling produces a representation of a corpus that is valid at all for a particular research question, it ought to be broadly valid for a range of different settings of *k*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressure to define a \"reasonable\" value of *k* comes mostly from the practice of attaching interpretive labels to individual topics. When topics are interpreted individually, it can seem problematic that two topics discussed separately at *k* = 200 might have been (partly) fused if the researcher had selected *k* = 100. Both models may be equally valid, mathematically. But it seems fair to ask researchers to justify the level of granularity they have chosen to discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce these justifications, however, researchers always have to import some assumptions about the desirable qualities of a model that weren't present in the topic-modeling algorithm itself. The commonly-used metric of \"exclusiveness,\" for instance, implies an assumption that the keywords in different topics should be non-overlapping. This is basically an assumption about the qualities a model should possess in order to be easily interpreted by a human reader. (And for what it's worth, Mimno et al. are able to validate this assumption against human judgement.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we want to produce a model that will roughly echo the level of granularity human readers are accustomed to when they discuss literary movements, themes, and genres. When we draw inferences about literary change, we hope to ensure that these inferences are valid *for that familiar level of granularity,*—and not only on some unfamiliar macroscopic or microscopic scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to ensure this would be to validate our choice of *k* against some ground truth reflecting actual human practice when it comes to the categorization of fiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we have a lot of ground truth to use. Shang and Underwood have parsed large amounts of [the index to the *Book Review Digest*,](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112097123480&view=1up&seq=572) which records subject and genre categories applied to works of fiction soon after they were published, from the 1920s to the present. In addition, we can use Library of Congress categories recorded in library metadata from the 1980s and 1990s. \n",
    "\n",
    "Putting these together, we constructed a set of 256 volumes that were present in our topic model and also grouped by human readers into 30 different categories of varying sizes. We used a variety of different metrics to compare the human partitioning of this set to the partitionings created by a topic model. We do not assume that the human categories are correct, or that they exhaustively cover the domain space, or in fact that they represent any kind of \"ground truth\" about fiction. Our goal is not to produce a model that would perfectly align with human judgment. (If a researcher wanted to do that, they would use a supervised method rather than topic modeling.) On the contrary, we are fairly confident that a topic model will identify many interesting historical clusters that a human cataloger might have overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are merely selecting a *level of granularity* for the model. It seems reasonable to do that by finding a setting where *some* categories in the model align well with *some* human concepts. Since we are only adjusting a single hyperparameter, it would be hard for this process to overfit the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cells below try two different measurement schemes: one that discretizes the topic model, and one that allows it to remain a fuzzy partitioning. The notebook ends by combining them."

Our confidence about details should be fairly low, and any value of k between 50 and 400 might be defensible. There's nothing obviously wrong about seeking a level of granularity *slightly* more, or less, detailed than the typical level in human reference books and library catalogs (which is itself variable)."

    "To evaluate this picture, remember that we're trying to maximize both axes —— or in other words, trying to move to the upper right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "If that's the goal, it appears that a variety of choices between 100 and 400 topics are almost equally defensible, depending on the exact balance of precision and generality desired in a particular inquiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The picture does, however, help us rule out extreme options like 25 topics, or 600. Those models might be quantitatively valid. But they will probably not be good approximations of the scale of categorization that human readers normally apply to fiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "(These results will not surprise people who have done a lot of topic modeling; they roughly align with the rule of thumb recommended, for instance, by [the designers of Mallet:](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php) \"The number of topics should depend to some degree on the size of the collection, but 200 to 400 will produce reasonably fine-grained results.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In our inquiry, we selected a model with 200 topics, which appeared to give a good balance between both of the metrics considered here. There were also other interpretive advantages to a relatively low setting of *k*, since increasing the number of topics might produce author-specific topics that would appear a bit circular for our research question. While there are methods of subtracting the author-specific signature [(Thompson and Mimno 2018),](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~laurejt/papers/authorless-tms-2018.pdf) that would also introduce a problematic kind of bias for the question we're investigating—-which is exactly about the stability or mutability of authorial style."
