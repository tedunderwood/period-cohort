Cohort effects and individual change in the history of fiction 1880-1999
========================================================================

Two interlocking experiments on literary change, which set out to illuminate the relative importance of cohort effects, event-driven period effects, and longitudinal change across an individual writer's career. Ted Underwood, Kevin Kiley, Wenyi Shang, Stephen Vaisey.

The two experiments are:

1. A regression experiment investigates the relationship between cohort effects and period effects in fiction 1890-1989.

2. Structural equation models compare the relative importance of active updating and settled dispositions across individual careers.

The project has a preregistration on the Open Science Framework at 
[10.17605/OSF.IO/4E2K7](https://osf.io/4e2k7).

Broadly speaking, corpus construction is documented in ```/dataconstruction```, and the final state of the corpus is in ```/metadata/finalcorpus.tsv```.

The development of a topic model is documented in ```/modelselection,``` and the process of coding topics in ```/interrater.```

The ```/regression``` folder documents our regression experiment, and the ```/sem-topics``` folder documents structural equation modeling on sequences across a single writer's career.

```/tripletdistance``` is an alternate way of thinking about change across individual careers.
