dataconstruction
================

Two Jupyter notebooks, not very well documented, that I used to fuzzy-match HathiTrust metadata (from [the NovelTM Datasets](https://github.com/tedunderwood/noveltmmeta)) to [the NYPL's digitized version of US copyright registry.](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2019/05/31/us-copyright-history-1923-1964)

Other parts of the corpus were drawn from manually-tagged NovelTM data, from the Chicago Novel Corpus, and from additional local work undertaken by Ted Underwood and Wenyi Shang in support of this experiment. (In particular, we tried to enrich the 'shoulders' of the century we modeled, which were not adequately covered by the copyright registry.)
